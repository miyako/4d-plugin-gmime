/**
 * g_mime_iconv:
 * @cd: iconv_t conversion descriptor
 * @inbuf: input buffer
 * @inleft: number of bytes left in @inbuf
 * @outbuf: output buffer
 * @outleft: number of bytes left in @outbuf
 *
 * The argument @cd must be a conversion descriptor created using the
 * function #g_mime_iconv_open.
 *
 * The main case is when @inbuf is not %NULL and *inbuf is not
 * %NULL. In this case, the #g_mime_iconv function converts the
 * multibyte sequence starting at *inbuf to a multibyte sequence
 * starting at *outbuf. At most *inleft bytes, starting at *inbuf,
 * will be read. At most *outleft bytes, starting at *outbuf, will
 * be written.
 *
 * The #g_mime_iconv function converts one multibyte character at a
 * time, and for each character conversion it increments *inbuf and
 * decrements *inleft by the number of converted input bytes, it
 * increments *outbuf and decrements *outleft by the number of
 * converted output bytes, and it updates the conversion state
 * contained in @cd. The conversion can stop for four reasons:
 *
 * 1. An invalid multibyte sequence is encountered in the input. In
 * this case it sets errno to %EILSEQ and returns (size_t)(-1).
 * *inbuf is left pointing to the beginning of the invalid multibyte
 * sequence.
 *
 * 2. The input byte sequence has been entirely converted, i.e.
 * *inleft has gone down to %0. In this case #g_mime_iconv returns
 * the number of non-reversible conversions performed during this
 * call.
 *
 * 3. An incomplete multibyte sequence is encountered in the input,
 * and the input byte sequence terminates after it. In this case it
 * sets errno to %EINVAL and returns (size_t)(-1). *inbuf is left
 * pointing to the beginning of the incomplete multibyte sequence.
 *
 * 4. The output buffer has no more room for the next converted
 * character. In this case it sets errno to %E2BIG and returns
 * (size_t)(-1).
 *
 * A different case is when @inbuf is %NULL or *inbuf is %NULL, but
 * @outbuf is not %NULL and *outbuf is not %NULL. In this case, the
 * #g_mime_iconv function attempts to set @cd's conversion state to
 * the initial state and store a corresponding shift sequence at
 * *outbuf.  At most *outleft bytes, starting at *outbuf, will be
 * written.  If the output buffer has no more room for this reset
 * sequence, it sets errno to %E2BIG and returns (size_t)(-1).
 * Otherwise it increments *outbuf and decrements *outleft by the
 * number of bytes written.
 *
 * A third case is when @inbuf is %NULL or *inbuf is %NULL, and
 * @outbuf is %NULL or *outbuf is %NULL. In this case, the
 * #g_mime_iconv function sets @cd's conversion state to the initial
 * state.
 *
 * Returns: the number of characters converted in a nonreversible way
 * during this call; reversible conversions are not counted. In case
 * of error, it sets errno and returns (size_t)(-1).
